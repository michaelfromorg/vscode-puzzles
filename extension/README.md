# vscode-puzzles ðŸ§©ðŸ§ 

<h3 style="text-align: center"><i>Puzzles</i> allows you to sharpen your coding skills inside of <i>your tailored Visual Studio Code environment</i> and add <i>your own tests</i>.</h3><br />

Solve problems from Reddit's [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/), [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), and [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java) in a fully-featured IDE, rather than a ```<textarea />``` (ugh), and write custom test cases, akin to a real job interview... which is the  whole point of your practice anyway!

Use Puzzles to **prepare for technical interviews** and start **solving coding problems** like you would in actual interviews today!

<br />
<h3 style="text-align: center">See how quickly you can get coding!</h3>

_Want to practice LeetCode specifically?_ Check out [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LeetCode.vscode-leetcode) extension instead! It should be what you're after... though Puzzles likely can help you as well!

## Getting Started

Here's how to build _Puzzles_ into your daily coding practice routine.

1. Download this extension!
2. Create a folder for your solutions

    ```shellscript
    # For example...
    cd ~
    mkdir puzzles
    cd puzzles
    code .
    ```

3. Hit `CTRL + SHIFT + P`, type `puzzles` and select your problem of choice
4. Get to solving!
5. (Optional) Initialize a Git repository in your new folder and publish your work to GitHub!

See this in practice (and code along with me) [here](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/puzzles)!

## Features

As mentioned, _Puzzles_ currently supports problems from r/dailyprogrammer, ProjectEuler, and CodingBat. It fetches a random problem for any of those three sites, creates a folder, and stores both a markdown file with the problem description and creates a `.py` file for you to begin your solution.

An outline of planned features is below!

### Roadmap

Here's my plan for near-future development:

- [ ] Support other programming language starters
- [ ] Make starters better. Include unit test templates, for example
- [ ] Support CTCI problems
- [ ] Create a custom, curated list of coding problems to use for this extension

## Requirements

None required! Note that Puzzles does create fodlers and files though, so you'll likely want to create a separate workspace on your computer for your work.

## Extension Settings

In the future, there will be an option to set your preferred solving language.

## Known Issues

Currently, the extension is a bit... shaky. There is a plan to stop scraping soon and add a better data source. If you experience any issues at all, open an [issue](https://github.com/michaelfromyeg/vscode-puzzle/issues) or reach out via [email](mailto:mdemar01@student.ubc.ca?subject=%5BPuzzles%5D) for support!
