# Server

This folder serves as the backend for the "vscode-puzzle" VSCode extension, designed at providing you with a daily coding puzzle. The API is currently live on Heroku [here](https://vscode-puzzle.herokuapp.com/).

## Guide

API specification is TBD!

To deploy the application, first commit your changes, and then run `git subtree push --prefix server heroku master` from the top level directory.
