# Daily Problem for VSCode

Daily Problem is a super simple VSCode add-on that collects a problem from the internet and brings it directly into your editor. Practice your programming skills with ease.

## Features

Daily Problem currently supports problems from r/dailyprogrammer, ProjectEuler, and CodingBat. It fetches a random problem for any of those three sites, creates a folder, and stores both a markdown file with the problem description and creates a `.py` file for you to begin your solution. Here's an example of an output.

> In the future, there is a plan to support a different preferred export type (other than Python), and problems from different websites.
